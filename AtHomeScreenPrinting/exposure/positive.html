                        		<p><br />Go grab the positive I had you print off back in the design phase. Also grab the can of temporary spray adhesive and the black posterboard.<br /><br />Now that the screen is completely dry it is sensitive to light. First take one of the posterboards and spray adhesive it to the inside of the screen, the side not flush to the metal frame (2,3). Then flip the screen around and spray adhesive the image positive to the backside of the screen, the side flush to the frame (4,5,6). Finally, gently spray adhesive the second piece of posterboard covering the backside of the screen and the image positive (7). Let's go outside.</p>
