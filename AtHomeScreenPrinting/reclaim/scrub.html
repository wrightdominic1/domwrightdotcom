                        	<p><br />Once the emulsion remover is soaked in it'll be time to scrub!<br /><br />In screen studios they use power washers so you could use that if you have access to one. You could also bring it to a car wash. <br /><br />I don't have access to either so I will use green brillo pads and scrub it off! Older screens are more susceptible to ripping so apply pressure as you see fit. Keep applying photo emulsion remover where necessary.<br /><br /></p>
