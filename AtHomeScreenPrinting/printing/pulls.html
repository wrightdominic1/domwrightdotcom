                        		<p><br />With the screen flooded with ink, pull your squeegee with force over the flooded area. Place the blade of squeegee above the image area, hold the squeegee at a 45 degree angle and firmly pull toward you. <em>Your very first pull should be on the clear piece of vinyl</em> (You'll see why in the next step). <br/><br />Since we're doing a shirt we'll need more ink on the shirt. Without lifting up the screen, flood the screen again and take another pull.<br /><br />Flood the screen immediatley after lifting the screen from the t-shirt so the ink doesn't dry out within the mesh of the screen.</p>
