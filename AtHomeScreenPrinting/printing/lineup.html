                        	<p><br />The very first pull you take should be on a piece of vinyl that's been firmly secured with tape. This is so we can line up the placement of the image.<br/><br/>A good t-shirt graphic is three fingers from the collar for shirt sizes small and medium, four fingers for large and extra large. You can use a piece of tape to mark the center of the shirt. If you don't care how it's centered you can just eyeball it.<br/><br/>My piece of vinyl was dirty from previous print jobs before this demo (hence the foggyness of the image).</p>
