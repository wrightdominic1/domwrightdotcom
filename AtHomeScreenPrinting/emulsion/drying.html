                        		<p><br />Now that it's coated it needs to dry in a dark place.<br /><br />I stuck it in my closet with a fan but be very careful because emulsion doesn't wash out of clothes very easily. Remember that gravity will take hold of the big globs and drip it onto the floor. Cover the floor with newspaper or something.<br /><br /><em>Wait for the emulsion to be completely dry before you take it out.</em> Be careful with how much exposure to light the screen recieves when you check on it.</p>
