                        	<p><br />Once the emulsion is mixed to a nice teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle green we can coat it onto our screen. The type of screen mesh in the picture is where the yellow color comes from. Pour the emulsion directly onto your screen in an even line across the bottom. Hold your squeegee at a 45 degree angle and pull across the screen in one motion. The goal here is to try and get one smooth and even pull across the screen, big enough to cover the area of your image. <br /><br />If the pull isn't how you like then wash it off and try again. Water desaturates the toxicity so you can wash it off in the grass or in the shower.</p>
