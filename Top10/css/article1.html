                    <br>“There’s a problem with what people know about government and civics -- and that problem is that people know surprisingly little,” according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
<br>
<br>The center has a pretty good idea of just how little our citizens know thanks to a survey it released last fall which showed that barely one in three of us, 36 percent,  could name the three branches of the federal government — or even one of them.
Some states are starting to do something about that.
In Illinois state Rep. Deborah Conroy, has introduced a pair of bills to begin attacking the problem starting in the 2016-2017 school year. HB 4025 would require a civics course for all Illinois high school students. HB 4024 supports teacher training. “We need to be giving our youth across the state the tools they need to become active members of their community and the future leaders our state needs,” Rep. Conroy said. “By introducing a civics education requirement and expanding the opportunities for young people to get registered to vote we are taking steps to help young people across the state get involved and active in their communities.” 
<br>
<br>There’s so many different interests fighting for the limited time students spend in the classroom. Education emphasis continues to shift and change while classroom dollars decline. Civic education proponents offer compelling arguments for pushing good citizenship training to the head of the line.
<br>
<br>To make that happen parents, citizens and taxpayers are urged to let their lawmakers know that you believe education should have a strong civic component, one which does more than merely teach facts, but encourages good citizenship participation and ethics in all states which starve for both.
<br>
<br>It isn’t difficult and we can start today, together.
