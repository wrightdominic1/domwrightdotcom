                    <p>Growing up this was the first hip hop single I would call into the radio to request. But they would never play it. My parents wouldn't let me buy the album because of the parental advisory on the cover (and looking back, probably the album art, too). I always attempted to record the song off the radio onto a cassette tape, and I wouldn't hear the uncensored version till years later when my dad found a CD multicase holder in a parking lot that had this album in it. It was the first hip hop record I owned and impacted me to change my attitude about hip hop. I wasn't a fan of hip hop as a genre since I judged it by what they played on the radio. But now it's my most played and explored genre.<br><br>I still have that original CD my dad found but that stays in my car. One of my favorite albums of all time, I bought the 2 disc LP so I'd have a physical copy to play on my home stereo.</p>
